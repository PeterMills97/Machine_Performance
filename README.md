# Machine_Performance
This is an exploritory data anaylsis that I created for an interview at a data consultancy. The data contians 10,000 hours of machine performance and was provided to me with the brief: "What can you tell us about our machine's performance?". 

The respository contains 3 files: the raw data, a notebook explaining my analysis, and the slides I used in my presentation.
